     select c1.city as City, c1.customerName as customerName, c2.customerName as customerName from customers c1, customers c2 
     where c1.customerNumber<>c2.customerNumber AND c1.city=c2.city order by c1.city;

    inner join productlines pl on p.productLine=pl.productLine;
    
-- Write a query that returns order number, order status, and total sales from the orders and orderdetails tables as follows:
    select o.orderNumber, o.status, sum(od.quantityOrdered*od.priceEach) as total from orders o 
    inner join orderdetails od on o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber group by o.orderNumber;

-- Write a query to fetch the complete details of orders from the orders, orderDetails, and products table, and sort them by orderNumber and orderLineNumber as follows:
    select o.orderNumber,o.orderDate,od.orderLineNumber, p.productName, od.quantityOrdered, od.priceEach from orders o 
    inner join orderdetails od on o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber inner join products p on od.productCode=p.productCode 
    order by orderNumber,orderLineNumber;

-- Write a query to perform INNER JOIN of four tables:
    select o.orderNumber,o.orderdate,c.customerName,od.orderLineNumber,p.productName, od.quantityOrdered,od.priceEach from products p 
    inner join orderdetails od on p.productCode=od.productCode
    inner join orders o on od.orderNumber=o.orderNumber
    inner join customers c on o.customerNumber=c.customerNumber
    order by orderNumber,orderLineNumber;

-- Write a query to find the sales price of the product whose code is S10_1678 that is less than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) for that product as follows:
    select od.orderNumber, p.productName, msrp, priceEach from orderdetails od

-- Write a query that uses the LEFT JOIN to find customers who have no order:
    select c.customerNumber, c.customerName, o.ordernumber, o.status Ffrom customers c
    left join orders o on c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber and o.ordernumber is null;
