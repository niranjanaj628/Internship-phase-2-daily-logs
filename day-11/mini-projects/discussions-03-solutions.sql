    select o.orderNumber, o.status, sum(od.quantityOrdered*od.priceEach) as total from orders o 
    inner join orderdetails od on o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber group by o.orderNumber;

-- Write a query to fetch the complete details of orders from the orders, orderDetails, and products table, and sort them by orderNumber and orderLineNumber as follows:
    select o.orderNumber,o.orderDate,od.orderLineNumber, p.productName, od.quantityOrdered, od.priceEach from orders o 
    inner join orderdetails od on o.orderNumber=od.orderNumber inner join products p on od.productCode=p.productCode 
    order by orderNumber,orderLineNumber;

-- Write a query to perform INNER JOIN of four tables:
    select o.orderNumber,o.orderdate,c.customerName,od.orderLineNumber,p.productName, od.quantityOrdered,od.priceEach from products p 
    inner join orderdetails od on p.productCode=od.productCode
